#### Formulas

- **Downstream**: In water, the direction along the stream
- **Upstream**: In water, the direction against the stream
- If the speed of a boat in still water is _u_ km/hr and the speed of the stream is _v_ km/hr, then:
    - Speed downstream = (_u_ + _v_) km/hr.
    - Speed upstream = (_u_ - _v_) km/hr.
- If the speed downstream is _a_ km/hr and the speed upstream is _b_ km/hr, then:
    - Speed in still water = $\frac{1}{2}(a + b) \ \text{km/hr}$
    - Rate of stream = $\frac{1}{2}(a - b) \ \text{km/hr}$
