## Principal  
- The money borrowed or lent out for a certain period is called the **principal** or the **sum**.

## Interest  
- Extra money paid for using anotherâ€™s money is called **interest**.

## Simple Interest (S.I.)  
- If the interest on a sum borrowed is calculated uniformly over time, it is called **simple interest**.  

### Formula  
Let:  
- **Principal** = $P$  
- **Rate** = $R\%$ per annum (p.a.)  
- **Time** = $T$ years  

**Simple Interest** is calculated as:  
$$ \text{Simple Interest (S.I.)} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} $$
