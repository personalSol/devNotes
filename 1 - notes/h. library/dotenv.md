> this is all for nodeJS applications. React and next and other applications have their own way to handle .env
- From what I understood, we use dotenv so that we can hide data/variables from showing up when we deploy this code.
- helps us lode environment variables
- should be loaded asap in program
- can't be ever uploaded to github
- to access values inside `.env` we use `process.env.<variable name>`
- The line `require('dotenv').config();` does two things:
	1. `require('dotenv')` imports the dotenv package
	2. `.config()` immediately executes its configuration function, which loads environment variables from a .env file into `process.env`
	This is a common pattern in Node.js when you need to chain an action right after importing.
- 

**there are three ways to do this:**
- first is to use require method
```js
const dotenv = require('dotenv');
dotenv.config();

// or 

require('dotenv').config();

```

- second is import method
```js
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config()
```

- third method is using experimental commands with `module` type
```js
// in this we write this in terminal
node -r dotenv/config --experimental-json-modules index.js
```

  -  When to Use `--import dotenv/config`

|Use Case|Recommendation|
|---|---|
|You're using `node` with **pure ESM** (ES modules)|✅ Use `--import dotenv/config`|
|You want to avoid adding `import 'dotenv/config'` in every script|✅ Use `--import dotenv/config`|
|You're running multiple scripts with shared env needs|✅ Useful for CLI tools and testing|
