**intro**
- use to update content/variables in a page without reloading the page or using normal DOM
- limitation: state will go to initial value if page reloads
- to use variables inside react, we use `expression or evaluated expression or {}` and write variable inside these curly braces
- hooks are basically functions which return something

## types of hooks:

- state management hooks:
	- [[Hooks - useState]]

- effect hooks
	- [[hooks - useEffect]]
	- 
- performance hooks
	- `useCallback()`
		- use to optimize the function and not execute it
		- **memoizes**Â the function, meaning it creates a new version of the function only when its dependencies change.
		- it only stores the values in cache and not run them
		- it is used for function and prevents it from being recreated and only recreates when one of the dependencies of useCallBack changes
- ref hooks - [[hooks- useRef]]
- Random hooks
	- useID - [[hooks - useId]]
	- useNavigate - [[react hook - useNavigate]]
