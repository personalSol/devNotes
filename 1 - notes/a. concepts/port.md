In networking, **ports** are `logical` endpoints used by protocols to identify `specific processes` running on a computer or server. They help direct network traffic to the correct application or service on a system.

Port is a 4 or 5 digits number. And we connect through a port to transfer data.  
  
there are two types of port:  
- Open Port: When the port is not already connected to somebody and we can connect with it to transfer data.
- Closed Port: When the port is already connected and busy in transfering data.
