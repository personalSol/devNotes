Asymmetric encryptionÂ uses two different keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The keys are mathematically related, but what one key locks (encrypts), only the other key can unlock (decrypt).

> asymmetric means not symmetric or same

- **Secure Email**: When someone wants to send you a secure email, they use your public key(your mail address) to encrypt the message. Only you, with your private key, can decrypt and read the email.
