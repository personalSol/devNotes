### üß† **Core Concepts: Program, Process, Thread, and Core**

- **üß© Core**
    - A **core** is an individual processing unit inside a CPU.
    - Modern CPUs have **multiple cores**, allowing them to perform several tasks **simultaneously** (true parallelism).

---

- **üì¶ Program**
    - A **program** is a set of instructions written in a programming language that tells the computer how to perform a task.
    - Example: **Microsoft Word** is a program used to create and edit documents.

---

- **‚öôÔ∏è Process**
    - A **process** is an **active instance** of a program being executed.
    - The OS creates a process to manage resources and execution when a program runs.
    - Example: When you open Microsoft Word, it becomes a **process** in the system.

---

- **üßµ Thread**
    - A **thread** is the **smallest unit of execution** within a process.
    - A single process can have **multiple threads** sharing the same memory and resources.
    - Threads run **independently**, allowing concurrent tasks.
    - Example: Opening **Google Chrome** creates one process, but each open tab or background task (like video playback or downloads) runs as a **separate thread**.


### üîÑ **Multitasking vs. Multithreading

- **Multitasking**
    - Operates at the **process level** ‚Äî processes are the OS‚Äôs main units of execution.
    - Enables multiple applications to run **simultaneously**.
    - Boosts **productivity** and overall **system utilization**.
- **Multithreading**
    - Operates at the **thread level** ‚Äî threads are lightweight units within a process.
    - Allows a single application to handle **multiple tasks in parallel**.
    - Enhances **performance** and keeps applications **responsive**.
- **How They Relate**
    - Multitasking often involves multiple **applications** running at once.
    - Multithreading focuses on multiple **threads** within a single application.
    - Multitasking can be achieved through multithreading by breaking tasks into concurrent threads.
- **Real-World Example: Web Browser**
    - Uses multithreading to split responsibilities across threads, such as:
        - **Rendering** the webpage
        - **Running JavaScript**
        - **Handling user input**
    - This ensures a **smooth**, **efficient**, and **responsive** browsing experience.
- **Analogy: Office Environment**
    - The **Operating System** is like an office manager.
    - Each **Process** is an employee working on a different **project** (application).
    - Within a project, multiple **Threads** are team members working on separate tasks **together**, sharing resources and collaborating in real time.
