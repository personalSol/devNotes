| **Aspect**              | **Statically Typed Language**          | **Dynamically Typed**                        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Type Checking**       | At **compile-time**                    | At **runtime**                               |
| **Declaration**         | Types are **explicit or inferred**     | Types are **implicit**                       |
| **Examples**            | Java, C, C++, Rust, Go, TypeScript     | Python, JavaScript, Ruby                     |
| **Flexibility**         | Less flexible (stricter)               | More flexible (can change types)             |
| **Safety**              | Safer from type errors at runtime      | More prone to runtime type errors            |
| **Performance**         | Often **faster**, optimized            | Often **slower** due to runtime checks       |
| **Mutability Handling** | Often **enforced by keywords/types**   | **Based on convention**, runtime behavior    |
| **Immutability Tools**  | `final`, `const`, `val`                | No strict enforcement; use tuples, frozenset |
| **Example Error Time**  | Compile-time (won't even run if error) | Runtime (errors happen while program runs)   |
