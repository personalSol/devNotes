## encapsulation

Encapsulation hides the details which should not be publically accessible.
- firstly they should be encapsulated inside a class
	- characters ( properties ) and behaviours ( methods ) related to one object should all be inside a single class
- restricting access to some characters which shouldn't be directly accessible to user
	- it's doesn't hide the data because it's unnecessary
	- it hides the data because the data is important and wants to improve data security
	- use private and getters and setters
