**Polymorphism** means "many forms."  
It allows the **same function name** to behave **differently based on the object's type**.

> Example: A `draw()` function can draw a circle, square, or triangle based on the object.

two types basically:
- method overloading
	- difining the same method again in same class with different parameter or parameter types and not on based of return types
- method overridding
	- defining the same method again in different class and changing it according to the needs of that class

## Summary Table

| Type         | Java                | C++                     |
|--------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Compile-time | Method Overloading  | Function/Operator Overload |
| Runtime      | Method Overriding   | Virtual Functions        |
