```cpp

int *balance; // created a pointer but it's not pointing to anything rn
balance = new int; // this will create a storage and store its adrres in balance
*balance = 10 // assigned a value to store in that variable
```

### whole concept 

- A variable stores a value (e.g. `int age = 25;`)
- That value lives at a specific location in memory ‚Äî called an **address**
	- we use address when we want to reference the variable directly and not copy it's value
- `&` gives the **address of a variable**
	- a memory address like `0x61ff08`, not a normal number.
	- A **memory address** is a special kind of value ‚Äî it's not just an `int`, it's an **address in memory**.


**Pointers**
- **pointer** stores the **address of another variable**
- uses `*` to declare a pointer variable
	- because `int ptr` is a normal int variable not meant to store address
- pointer variable only holds the address of variable and not the variable valaue itself
- `*` dereferences the variable and gives us the value ^945d8d
	- `*ptr` ‚Üí gives the **value at that address** (called **dereferencing**).
	- `&variable` ‚Üí gives us address
	- `ptr` ‚Üí stores the address.
- `int *ptr = a`  reads as ptr is a pointer which is pointing to integer type value
- datatype of`pointer` and `variable` it's storing address of should be of same type
	- so that pointer knows what type it's pointing to
		- have to use `char*` to store address of `char` address, `int*` to store int address, etc
	- ‚≠êas we know from [[cpp pointers#what gives]] that pointer only stores the address of first byte for that variable
		- data type tells the compiler to start from pointer address and read this much ( size of datatype ) bytes of data
		- ex: a int variable stored in char pointer will make compiler only read the first byte to get int value but int value will be stored in 4 bytes so it will grab the wrong value which will create problem for us
		- it the variabe will be of long type then it will read 8 bytes of data starting from that address
	- declaring it with same type helps compiler understand:
		- How many bytes to read from that address.
		- How to treat the value at that address.




**Extra**:
- when we print address then it gives hexadecimal value and the simple reason is to increase readability. 
- pointer size is directly associated to OS type/ram and not connected to the type of variable it stores.
	- a char ( 1 byte ) address can be of 4 or 8 bytes.


```cpp

int age = 21;

//declaring a pointer
int* ptr = &age; // ‚úî Correct
int ptr = &age;  // ‚ùå Not allowed // storing address in a regular int

// Same thing ‚Äî just a different spacing style
int *ptr;  || int* ptr;

// gives address of age
cout<<ptr<<endl; 
cout<<&age<endl;

// `*` dereferences and we get the variable directly
// means *ptr is as good as age itself
cout<<*ptr<<endl 

*ptr = 30;

cout<<age<<endl; // will give 30

int *ptr3; // pointed to nothing so stores null

// ----- mutability-----

int a = 10;
int *ptr = &a;
cout<<*ptr<<endl; // prints 10
int b = 20;
ptr = &b;
cout<<*ptr<<endl; // will print 20
b++;
cout<<ptr<<endl; // will print 21

```


### what `& gives`

üìå `int a = 10;` (Assuming `int` = 4 bytes)
- `a` occupies **4 consecutive bytes** in RAM.
- **Each byte** has a **unique address**.
- The compiler assigns `a` a **starting address** (e.g., 0x1000).
- `&a` returns the address of the **first byte** only.
- The remaining 3 bytes are at **next consecutive addresses** (e.g., 0x1001, 0x1002, 0x1003).
- You **don‚Äôt store 4 addresses** ‚Äî you just use the starting one.
- The idea that ‚Äúan address points to 1 byte‚Äù is **still correct** ‚Äî you just need multiple bytes for larger data types.


‚úÖ So: What‚Äôs actually happening?

| Byte # | Address (example) | Value                             |
| ------ | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1st    | 0x1000            | 00001010 (depends on endian-ness) |
| 2nd    | 0x1001            | ...                               |
| 3rd    | 0x1002            | ...                               |
| 4th    | 0x1003            | ...                               |

### üéØ Analogy

Imagine this:
- üè† `age = 25`: A house with the number 25 inside.
- üìç `&age`: The **address** of the house.
- üì¨ `int ptr = &age`: You‚Äôre trying to put the address (like "123 Main St") inside a box meant only for numbers like 25. That doesn't fit.

You need a special **address box**:
- üì¶ `int* ptr = &age`: Now the address fits perfectly!

### summary

|**Concept**|**Code Example**|**What It Means / Does**|**Why It Works That Way**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Declare a pointer**|`int* ptr;`|`ptr` can store the address of an `int`|`*` tells C++: this variable is a pointer to `int`, not a normal int value|
|**Get address of variable**|`&age`|Returns memory address of `age`|Needed to store in a pointer or pass by reference|
|**Store address in pointer**|`ptr = &age;`|`ptr` now points to `age`|Pointer holds memory address; `&` gives that address|
|**Access value at address**|`*ptr`|Dereferences `ptr` to access or modify value at that address|`*` follows the address and accesses the actual value stored there|
|**Print pointer address**|`cout << ptr;`|Outputs the address stored in `ptr`|Helpful for debugging or understanding memory layout|
|**Print value pointed to**|`cout << *ptr;`|Outputs value stored at the pointed-to memory location|Shows the real data that the pointer is referencing|
|**Pointer type must match**|`int* ptr = &age;`|Stores address of `int` variable in `int*` pointer|C++ needs to know what type of data is at the address to read/write it correctly|
|**Incorrect usage**|`int ptr = &age;`|‚ùå Trying to store address in a regular int|Regular `int` isn't designed to hold memory addresses ‚Äî leads to type mismatch errors|
|**Other pointer types**|`float*`, `char*`, etc.|Pointers for different variable types|Needed to interpret and manage memory for those specific data types|
