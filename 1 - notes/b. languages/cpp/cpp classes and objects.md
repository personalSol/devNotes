#### ðŸ”¹ Constructor

- A **special function** that runs automatically when an object is created.
- Used to **initialize** class members.
- **Types**: Default, Parameterized, Copy, Move.
-  If **no constructor is defined**, C++ provides a **default constructor** automactically
	- that constructor consists of no argyments and does nothing but still compilers provides one

> It's like an auto-assembly machine that builds the robot instantly.

```cpp
Solution() {} Â // Auto-generated by the compiler
```

```cpp
class Robot {
public:
    string name;

    // Constructor
    Robot(string robotName) {
        name = robotName;
        cout << "Robot " << name << " created!" << endl;
    }

    void sayHello() {
        cout << "Hi! I'm " << name << endl;
    }
};


// creating stack object
Robot r1("Wall-E");  // Constructor is called
r1.sayHello();       // Output: Hi! I'm Wall-E

// creating heap object
Robot* r2 = new Robot("EVA");  // Constructor runs
r2->sayHello();
delete r2;  // Must delete manually
```
