### what

- stands for Document Object Model,
- programming interface for web documents
- represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects.
	![[Screenshot_2024-08-17_at_4.26.44_PM.png||250]]
- code for above tree
```js
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Simple app</title>
		<meta name="description" content="A brief description of the webpage content for search engines and social media.">
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>
			hi there
		</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```

### why


The DOM abstracts the structure of the document into a tree of objects ( like in the photo of example shared above ), allowing scripts to manipulate the content and structure( of that html website ) dynamically. This abstraction enables more complex interactions and functionalities beyond just static HTML.

Basically the approach we have here is we first fetch or select the element. We can print it or stuff or we can update it using updating elements or delete it using delete elements. Lastly we can add new elements.
