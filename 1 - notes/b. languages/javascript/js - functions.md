in Arrow function, if we use 
- {}
	- have to use return explicitly
- implicitly
	- don't have to use `{}` and it implcitly returns the value written inside
- we can't use this as it doesn't know this/current context

in normal function, we have:
- we have context of this

- [[js arrow function]]
-
