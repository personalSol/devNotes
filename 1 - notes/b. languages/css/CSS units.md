units are of two types
- absolute
- relative

px - absolute

relative:
- vh/vw: changes according to viewport
	- vh - applied to height
	- cw - applied to width
- %: changes according to parent element
- em: 
    1em = 16px
    em values are dependant uppon font size of current and parent element
- rem
    1rem = 16px
    rem values are also dependant on font size but not of current element. 
    it's dependant on root elements font size which is html element/tag



body tag doesn't have height by default because of infinite scroll.

body tag does have width which is equal to viewport
because body tag doesn't have defined height that's why if we apply percent to it's child then it doesn't work.



extra:

we can't give height and width to inline elements
