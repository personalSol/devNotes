### [[CSS flex property - not flex box]]

- applies on parent node and works on child nodes
- A flexbox always consists of:
	- a **Flex Container** - the parent (container) `<div>` element
	-  **Flex Items** - the items inside the container `<div>`
- the simple first effect that happens is div which takes full lines now adjusts side by side like span



### align-items

- use to allign items vertically in a container
- Common Values:
	- `stretch`: Items fill the container’s height (default).
	- `flex-start`: Items stick to the **top**.
	- `flex-end`: Items stick to the **bottom**.
	- `center`: Items are **centered** vertically.
	- `baseline`: Items align based on their text’s baseline.
