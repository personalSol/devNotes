- depricated method
	`npx create-react-app 01basicreact`: 
	- not used anymore
	- very bulky and have things that we might not require in every project
	- in this when we run build script through `npm run dev`
		- the build file that gets created is the file which browser recieves at the end
	- this package json comes from creating react app method 
	![[Pasted image 20250303211314.png]]
	here two main libraries are react and react dom. 
	- jest is used for testing
	- vitals is used for track things like speed an all in wesbite
- `npm create vite@latest`:
	- only installs react and react-dom library
	- fast compared to create-react-app
