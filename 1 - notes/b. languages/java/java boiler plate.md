### **First-Principles Summary**:

- **Rule of the JVM**: The `main` method’s signature is a **non-negotiable contract** with the JVM.
- **Purpose of `args`**: It’s a tool for input, but you’re not forced to use it.
- **You can’t skip it**, but you can treat it as "optional" in your code if you don’t need input.

Think of it like a **required checkbox** on a form: you have to check it to submit (run the program), even if you don’t care about what’s inside. ✅


### **1. What is a "program"?**

A program is a set of instructions. For it to **start running**, there must be a **clear entry point** (like a door to a building). In Java, this entry point is the `main` method.

---

### **2. Why does Java enforce `public static void main(String[] args)`?**

- **The JVM’s Rule**: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is designed to look for **one specific door** to start your program.
- **Signature as a Contract**: The JVM expects the exact "shape" of the method:
    - `public` (accessible to the JVM),
    - `static` (no object needed to call it),
    - `void` (returns nothing),
    - `main` (the method name),
    - `String[] args` (a way to pass input).

If the method’s signature doesn’t match, the JVM can’t find the door. **It’s like a key that only fits one lock.**

---

### **3. What is `String[] args` fundamentally?**

- **Input for Flexibility**: When you run a program, you might want to **customize its behavior** without changing the code (e.g., passing a filename, a mode like `--debug`, etc.).
- **A Channel for Input**: The `args` array is a **bridge** between the terminal/command line and your program.

---

### **4. Can you skip `String[] args`?**

**No**, because:

- The JVM’s design requires the exact method signature.
- If you remove `String[] args`, the JVM no longer recognizes the `main` method as the entry point.

**But you can ignore `args`**:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Just don't use the 'args' variable here.  
    System.out.println("Hello World!"); 
}
```
