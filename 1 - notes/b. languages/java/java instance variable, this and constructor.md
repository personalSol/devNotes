instance variables:
- are the variables that are inside a class but not inside the class but not inside any method
- they are used to give properties/store value for properties for objects.


#### what I understood:

- there are mainly three things around classes to understand this:
	- instance variable
	- constructor
	- objects
- objects are real world entities which we create with the help of a class
	- an object contains all properties and methods of it's parent class
	- while creating a variable, we can pass values that are specific to that object
	- and we pass those values with the help of a constructor
	- now
- this:
	- this allows our constructor parameters to have same name as out instance variables and get no confusion.

### code ⭐


- Use `this` when constructor parameters have **same names** as instance variables.
- In regular methods like `showDetails()`, you **don’t need `this`** unless there’s a naming conflict.
- Java **implicitly uses `this.variableName`** when no local variable or parameter is hiding it. ^6uag0r


```java
public class MainClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating two car objects with different values
        Car car1 = new Car("White", 60, true);
        Car car2 = new Car("Red", 80, false);

        // Changing one instance variable of car1
        car1.color = "Yellow";

        // Showing details of both cars
        System.out.println("Car 1 details:");
        car1.showDetails();

        System.out.println("\nCar 2 details:");
        car2.showDetails();
    }
}

// Class definition
class Car {
    // Instance variables (each object gets its own copy)
    String color;
    int speed;
    boolean isWorking;

    // Constructor
    Car(String color, int s, boolean isWorking) {
        // Using 'this' because the parameter name is the same as the instance variable
        this.color = color;

        // No need for 'this' here because parameter name is different (s vs speed)
        speed = s;

        // Using 'this' again because names match
        this.isWorking = isWorking;
    }

    // Method to display values of instance variables
    void showDetails() {
        // These lines access instance variables directly.
        // 'this' is not required here because there's no name conflict.
        System.out.println("Color: " + color);         // same as this.color
        System.out.println("Speed: " + speed);         // same as this.speed
        System.out.println("Is Working: " + isWorking); // same as this.isWorking

        // Optional: If you want to be explicit, you can use 'this'
        // System.out.println("Color: " + this.color);
    }
}
```


```java
public class classes2 {  
    public static void main(String args[]){  
        cary car1 = new cary();  
        car1.name = "WagonR";  
        car1.color = "WHITE";  
        car1.getDetails();  
  
        cary car2 = new cary();  
        car2.getDetails();  
  
        car2.name = "BMW";  
        car2.color = "BLACK";  
        car2.getDetails();  
  
    }  
}  
  
class cary{  
  
    String name;  
    String color;  
  
    void getDetails(){  
        System.out.println("NAME: " + name);  
        System.out.println("COLOR: " + color);  
    }  
}
```
