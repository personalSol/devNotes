# ⭐1

- unlike js, which returns undefined until a variable is declared and not initialized. java gives error
	- but but we can access array without initializing it as it saves default values
		- int -> 0
		- string -> null
- in java by default, decimal values are stored as double
- arrays have length property and string have length() function
- java doesn't have truthy or falsy values
- doesn’t have negative indexing for any of it’s data types or structures
- zero based indexing
- java have `"=="` and `.equals()`: [[java String#^8kflsq]]
	- `"=="` checks if two references point to the **same object** (or primitive values are equal).
	- `.equals()` checks if the **content** of two objects is equal (usually overridden in custom classes).

Methods:
- `<wrapperClass>.MIN_VALUE`
- `<wrapperClass>.MAX_VALUE`


# ⭐2

- ternary operator: `(condition) ? ifTrue : ifFalse;`
- 

# ⭐3

- “;” is the statement terminator for java
