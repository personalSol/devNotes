    `process` is a global object that contains multiple properties and methods, including:
    - `process.env` - Environment variables
    - `process.argv` - Command line arguments
    - `process.pid` - Process ID
    - `process.platform` - Operating system platform
    - `process.version` - Node.js version
    - `process.exit()` - Exit the process  -- [[node process.exit()]]
    - `process.cwd()` - Current working directory
    You can access any of these directly without imports.
