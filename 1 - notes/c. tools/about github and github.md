```tabs
--- git
- Software
- Uses:
    - To keep record of different versions of code and get back to those versions of code
    - To work collaboratively
- In Git we first have to add and then commit changes.
- Free & Open Source
- Fast and scalable
- Works on VCS (Version Control System)

--- github
- Website
- We store our project and work in form of folder ( repository or repo )
- In GitHub, we can directly commit changes.
```

---

```tabs
--- stagging
- basically all the changes that we want included in next version
- In this we can select which files we want to commit one by one or all of them at ones using ‘.’ which means current folder

--- commiting
- Committing all the files which got ready by their name [which means successfully creating their version history].
- We don’t get to decide which file we want to commit
--- fork
A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original "upstream" repository. This basically means we are copying an entire repo[or master branch] in to GitHub by creating a new repo. We do this to contribute to projects and once we made our changes or added new feature into the repo. We create a pull request [commonly knows as PR] which allows the admin of main repo to see and accept our changes if they find it useful.

```

---

```tabs
--- .git
stores all our commands, stages, commits and details until we push

--- .gitignore
to mention all the files we want git to ignore
```
