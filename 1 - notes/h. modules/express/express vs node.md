    - can buid servers using HTTP core module
    - have a framework “express JS” which makes server building easier
- Express Js
    - Another npm package
    - used to build servers
    - uses core module HTTP of Node Js behind the scenes
    - industry prefers because it is easier, shorter and readable compared to HTTP.
    - have many alternatives but express JS is used most by far + there are other modules build on top of it which are super useful making it favorite in industry

Remember: Because Express is build on top of Node, we can’t use express without Node and it should be obvious that we can use node without express.
