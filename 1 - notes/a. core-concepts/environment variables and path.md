Environment variables are the path inside computer which can be accessed from anywhere. We can also set temporary path or make it permanently accessible from anywhere by adding it in environment variables.

- **Environment Variables**:
    - Labels that store _any_ key info (settings, user data, file paths).
    - Examples: `TEMP` (temp files), `USERNAME` (your account name).
- **PATH**:
    - A _specific_ environment variable listing **directories**.
    - Tells your computer where to look for programs (e.g., `python`, `notepad`).
    - Example: If `C:\\Python` is in PATH, typing `python` runs `C:\\Python\\python.exe`.

**Key Difference**:

- **Environment variables** = General-purpose labels.
- **PATH** = Specialized list for program locations.

**Analogy**:

- Environment variables = Sticky notes in a toolbox.
- PATH = A note saying "Check these drawers for tools."

what I understood: environment variables store all kind of data that your computer needs to access frequenctly and remember. Path is one of them which stores path of most important directories to look in while finding a program to run.
