**Algorithm**: Algorithm is step by step process of solving a problem
**Program**: Program is step by step process of solving a problem but using programming.

##### Characteristics of algorithm
- input: it can have 0 or more input
- output: atleast 1 output
- definiteness: problem must be clear and solvable and solving algorithm must also have a clear meaning
	- you are only doing possible operations and not something magical like finding root of negative numbers
- finiteness: it should terminate at some point
- effectiveness: there mustn't be any unnecessary things in algorithm 

##### to analyze an algorithm

- time
- space
- Network: How much data is getting transfered over the network
- power
- cpu registers
main are top 2


this is just my speculation but the way we check O(`<anything>`) is that we check if there is any variable in the last in f(n) or S(n) and if there is then we take that variable and it's exponent. If there is no variable then we consider variable with power 0 and it will be 1. We ignore constants
