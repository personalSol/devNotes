- what is api and why we write it backend separately instead of writing the entire logic in frontend
	- because of security around business logic, purpose of frontend, and performance issues
- what is a state in react
	- in react, state is used to store values just like variables but the different is that everytime a state changes the component it was created/used in will rerender
	- also unlike variable which stores the value until program ends, state value resets to initial value when the component re-renders.
- difference between arrow and normal function
- check useContext vs redux vs zustand code and concept
