I have realised purpopse of notes. The purpose of notes is to revise things quickly. That's all there is to it. 

Rn the js notes I have are too big and disorganised. I tried to revise them but I myself got confused a little. Also this niche is coding. If I write codes then there is chance that it might not work next time because it got updated. 

so in notes I should try to write only crisp notes and if I understand something tough then make a short note of it plus create a voice note of it explaining it to yourself for future reference. That's all no more detailed notes. If you want detailed notes then go to official documentation.
