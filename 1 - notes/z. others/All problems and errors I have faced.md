- now using await for async code like for database or for `.json()` or other asynchronous code
- return and saving method should be same
	- if you return a variable directly using varible name then you have to same it using same direct method
	- if you return a value using `{}` then you have to store it using `{}`
```js
return variable1;
const vairbale1 = abc;

return {variable2};
const {variable2} = abc;
```
