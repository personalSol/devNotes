Traditional AI:
- can't operate manually
- requires manual activation each time

AI Agents:
- AI agents are proactive personal assistants focused on achieving goals.
- They are workflows, not AI models (e.g., GPT, Gemini, Claude).
- Agents use AI models to make decisions during workflows.
- They understand broader goals and context.
- They break down complex tasks into smaller steps.
- They independently decide and adapt based on new information.
- They act without needing step-by-step guidance.
- They handle multi-step plans without user re-prompting.
- Some agents maintain memory of past actions to improve decision-making.
