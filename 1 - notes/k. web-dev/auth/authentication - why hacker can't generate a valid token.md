- because after tampering with the data, hacker will have to generate the signature too which requires the secret key.
- he can just keep the signature as it is as it compares the signature but the thing is if hacker changes the payload data but don't change the signature then the new signature generated from request header data will not match the signature it's attached with as that signature was created with a different data one which was not tampered.
