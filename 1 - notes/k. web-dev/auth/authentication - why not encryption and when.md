- **Passwords should never be encrypted and stored**, because encryption is reversible â€” if someone gets the private key of server, they can get every userâ€™s password.
- Instead, we **hash** passwords and **compare hash values**.

### ðŸ”„ Do We Ever Use Encryption in Authentication?

Yes â€” but **not for storing passwords**:

- **HTTPS (SSL/TLS)** uses encryption to securely **transmit** credentials from client to server.
- **JWTs (JSON Web Tokens)** might be encrypted or signed â€” signing uses hashing and keys (HMAC or RSA).
