- whenever starting any new topic, ask these three question. Ex:
	- why did I start array
	- what problem did it solved
	- what are array's limitations
- ask yourself questions like why was this data structure created, what problem was the person who created this trying to solve.
- always use first principle thinking

**how to revise**
- keep list of all the questions you were not able to solve
- revise all ( yes all ) the questions you were not able to do from the sheet before sleeping

**consistency**
- consistency is the key
- stay consistent
	- a person who is not consistent will achieve in 1 year what someone who is consistent will achieve in 3 months


**how much time to give to each question:**
- max 1 hour
- if you can't solve it after 30 mints then see the first hint
- still can't find a solution in 10 mints see the second one
- still can't then 3rd 
- only after this go to video solution
