features are types of associated data which we use to train a model. Like in a table of data used to predict if a person has heart disease or not ( which is the target ). 

we will use data like age, most frequent food eaten by patient, no. of times chest pain, etc. 

these all are features of data which affect the outcome/ target of model.

- for something to be a feature or a feature eligible to be used in model, the same feature must be available for all data and like it's available for 10% of data
	- in which case either we fill the missing data or don't consider that feature for training the model.
