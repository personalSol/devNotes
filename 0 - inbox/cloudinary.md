- an online service where we upload files
- this gives us link which then we use to show resources ( don't know how we show resources from url )
- first we have to config it with credentials which we get from the cloudinary website
- then we use it using uploader.upload
- we have also used [[fs#ðŸ”¹ fs unlinkSync]] to unlink/delete the file after successsful or unsuccessful completion of operation
- `response.url` is used to get the url to upload on database

```js
import { v2 as cloudinary } from "cloudinary";

// Configuration
cloudinary.config({
Â  Â  cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
Â  Â  api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
Â  Â  api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
});

const uploadFileOnCloudinary = async (localFilePath) => {
Â  Â  try {
Â  Â  Â  Â  if(!localFilePath) return null;
Â  Â  Â  Â  const response = await cloudinary.uploader.upload(localFilePath, {
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  resource_type: auto,
Â  Â  Â  Â  })

Â  Â  Â  Â  //upload successful message
Â  Â  Â  Â  console.log("File uploaded at", response.url);
Â  Â  Â  Â  fs.unlinkSync(localFilePath); // removing the file as it's no longer needed in system
Â  Â  Â  Â  return response;
Â  Â  } catch (error) {
Â  Â  Â  Â  fs.unlinkSync(localFilePath) // removed the locally saved temporary file as the upload got failed
Â  Â  Â  Â  return null;
Â  Â  }
}
```
