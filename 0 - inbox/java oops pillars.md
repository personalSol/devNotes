## encapsulation

**Encapsulation** means **hiding the internal details** of how something works and only showing whatâ€™s necessary.

Think of it like a **TV remote** â€” you donâ€™t know (or need to know) how it works inside. You just press buttons to control the TV.

### ðŸ’» In Java terms:

- We **hide variables** inside a class using `private`
- We use **`get` and `set` methods** to access or change those variables

---

### âœ… Why use encapsulation?

- Protect data from being changed in the wrong way
- Control how data is accessed or updated
- Makes the code easier to manage and safer

---

### ðŸ“¦ Simple Java Example:

```java
public class Person {
    // Private variable (hidden from outside)
    private String name;

    // Getter - to read the name
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter - to change the name
    public void setName(String newName) {
        name = newName;
    }
}
```

ðŸ§ª Using the class:
```java
Person p = new Person();
p.setName("John");             // set the name
System.out.println(p.getName());  // get the name
```
