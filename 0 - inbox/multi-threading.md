**Core**: A core is an individual processing unit within a CPU. Modern CPUs can have multiple cores, allowing them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

**Program:** 

A program is a set of instructions written in a programming language that tells the computer how to perform a specific task.

Microsoft Word is a program that allows users to create and edit documents.

**Process:**

A process is an instance of a program that is being executed. When a program runs, the operating system creates a process to manage its execution.

When we open Microsoft Word, it becomes a process in the operating system.

**Thread:**

A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. A process can have multiple threads, which share the same resources but can run independently.

Ex: open google chrome, it's a single program which perform multiple things and each task is like a thread running independently. 

**Multi-tasking:**

Multitasking allows an operating system to run multiple processes simultaneously. On single-core CPUs, this is done through rapidly switching between tasks. On multi-core CPUs, true parallel execution occurs, with tasks distributed across cores. The OS scheduler balances the load, ensuring efficient and responsive system performance.
