### **Q: What is the difference between `router.post()` and `router.route().post()`?**  
**A:**  
- `router.post(path, handler)` is a direct way to handle a `POST` request to a specific path.  
- `router.route(path).post(handler)` is part of a **chained method** for handling multiple HTTP verbs on the same route (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.).

---

### **Q: When should I use `router.post()`?**  
**A:**  
Use it when:
- You're handling **only one method** (like `POST`) for a given route.
- You want a **simple, short syntax**.

**Example:**
```js
router.post('/login', loginHandler);
```

---

### **Q: When should I use `router.route().post()`?**  
**A:**  
Use it when:
- You're handling **multiple methods** for the same route.
- You want **cleaner grouping** of related methods (like in REST APIs).

**Example:**
```js
router.route('/users')
  .get(getUsers)
  .post(createUser)
  .put(updateUser);
```

### **Q: Is there any functional difference between the two?**  
**A:**  
No, both achieve the same functionality. The difference is **organizational** â€” `router.route()` helps group multiple methods together for the same route.

---

### **Q: Which one is better for RESTful APIs?**  
**A:**  
`router.route()` is better because it:
- Groups related handlers (e.g., `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`) for the same resource.
- Makes routes easier to read and maintain.
