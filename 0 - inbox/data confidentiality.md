### 🔐 **Data Confidentiality** means:

> **Only authorized people can see the data.**  
> Everyone else is kept in the dark — even if they intercept the data, they can’t read it.



### 💡 Simple Example:

You're sending a private message to a friend:

- You encrypt the message.
- Only your friend has the key to decrypt it.
- Even if a hacker grabs the message in transit, it's just **gibberish** to them.

✅ That’s **confidentiality** — keeping the message **secret** from everyone except the intended recipient.

### 🔒 In Practice, Data Confidentiality is ensured by:

- **Encryption** (main tool)
- **Access controls** (e.g., passwords, user permissions)
- **Secure protocols** (like HTTPS, VPNs)

---

### 🧱 Key Concept:

- **Confidentiality ≠ Integrity**
    
    - Confidentiality → “No one else can **see** it.”
        
    - Integrity → “No one else has **changed** it.”
