### Redux State Per User: Key Points

- In a React app, **every user runs a separate instance of the app in their own browser.**
    
- **Redux state exists only in the memory of that specific browser tab/session.**
    
- Each user’s Redux state is **fully isolated** — users cannot access or affect each other’s state.
    
- **If the user refreshes, closes the tab, or navigates away, the Redux state is lost** (unless explicitly persisted using localStorage, sessionStorage, or Redux Persist).
    
- **Redux is client-side state management by default.**  
    It does not automatically sync or share state across users or devices.
    
- If you want to make the state **global across users or sessions,** you would need to store it on a backend server or use real-time tools like WebSockets.
    
- **Important:** Even if two tabs are open by the same user, each tab will have its own separate Redux state unless you manually implement cross-tab state sharing.
