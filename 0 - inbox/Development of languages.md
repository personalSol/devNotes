In the dawn of computer system world, we had:

- machine langugage which was used to feed commands to computer and have it calculate
	- it takes binary code which programmer had to write by themselves
	- fastest
- we then developed assembler which started accepting assembly language
	- assembler used to convert aassembly langugage into binary and vice versa
	- slower as compared to machine language
- we them developed high level language: like python/java which was much closer to how we write in real life and it made programmer's life easy
	- used compiler/interpreter to convert high level programming langugage into machine language
	- even more slower
