### what is AI:

In AI, the goal is to replicate human learning and decision-making processes by creating sophisticated computer programs that can:

- **Process vast data.**
- **Learn patterns.**
- **Make informed decisions.**

A practical example includes streaming platforms using AI to analyze user preferences, compare them with other users, and recommend shows or music, improving recommendations as more data (user interaction) is collected.
