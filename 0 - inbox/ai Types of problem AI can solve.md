Machine learning is a part of AI and has 3 types of problem it can solve based on data provided:

- Types are:
    - Unsupervised leaning: there are no labels for the training data. A machine learning algorithm tries to learn the underlying patterns or distributions that govern the data.
        - Means the data which is being given to model doesn’t have a specific given answer attached to it to help the machine recognise that it is correct and it isn’t. Instead model have to use different type of data and use that to get one answer whereas in supervise Ig there is only one type of data
        - recommendation system is a type of unsupervised learning model which takes a lot of data and find patterns in that data, based on patterns found in the data from user interactions and watch things. it recommends the user same type of content
        - another example is finding which customer might be more interested in buying winter cloths or summer cloths or in a cosmetic shop which customer comes to buy nailpolish and which comes to buy cream.
        - based on the patterns we find we create clusters of those into different groups and then further make informed decisions.
        - in this there is really no right or wrong
    - Supervised Learning: every training sample from the dataset has a corresponding label or output value associated with it. As a result, the algorithm learns to predict labels or output values.
        - We give it DATA and OUTPUT and tries to train the model to predict OUTPUT from NEW DATA
        - can be verified if it has accuracy or not or right or wrong
        - refer to data that already contains the solutions
        - had two types of problem:
            - classification problem: means the ourput has a limted number and can be classified
            - for example a patient has heart disease or not OR a image has dog or not
            - second is Regression problem: example is we want to predict the price of a house. Now it can be of various range so we really can't say it has a limited number of outcomes and hence cannot classsify it
    - Reinforcement learning: the algorithm figures out which actions to take in a situation to maximize a reward (in the form of a number) on the way to reaching a specific goal.
        - has yet to find a real world use case
    - Transfer learning: means transfering the learnings from one model to another based on similarities or similar needs.
