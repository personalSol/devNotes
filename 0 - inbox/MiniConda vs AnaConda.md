At the top level, we have **Miniconda** and **Anaconda**, which are two **Python distributions**.  
A _distribution_ means they bundle Python along with tools to manage packages and dependencies.

Both Miniconda and Anaconda come with **Conda**, which is an **environment and package management tool**.  
Conda helps create isolated environments and install/manage dependencies easily.

The main difference is that **Anaconda** comes with many preinstalled packages, while **Miniconda** is a minimal installation where you install only what you need.
- shouldn't directly delete a env as its metadata still remains
- named env get stored inside `~/miniconda3/envs/myenv`
- [[conda setup]]
