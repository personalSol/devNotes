Databases are organized collections of data that are structured to enable efficient storage, retrieval, and management of information.

Whenever you create a `full stack app` , you `persist` data in `databases`.

## Types of databases

- **Relational Databases**: Use tables to store data and relationships between data (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- **NoSQL Databases**: Designed for more flexible data models and often used for big data or real-time web applications (e.g., MongoDB).
- **Graph Databases**: Store data in nodes and edges to represent relationships (e.g., Neo4j).
- **Vector Databases**: Used in ML to store data in the form of embeddings
