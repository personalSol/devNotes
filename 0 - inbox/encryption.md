Encryption is the process of converting plaintext data into an unreadable format, called ciphertext, using a specific algorithm and a key. The data can be decrypted back to its original form only with the appropriate key.

**Key Characteristics:**


- **Purpose:** To protect data confidentiality — data can be **reversed (decrypted)** with a key.
- **Process:** Takes input (plaintext) and transforms it into unreadable ciphertext using an **encryption algorithm + key**.
- **Reversible:** ✅ Yes with the correct key, the ciphertext can be decrypted back to plaintext.
- **Key-dependent**: The security of encryption relies on the secrecy of the key.
- **Use Cases:**
    - Sending secure messages (e.g., WhatsApp).
    - File and disk encryption.
    - HTTPS (SSL/TLS).
- **Examples:** AES, RSA, DES.
- **Two main types**:
    - [[Symmetric encryption]]: The same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
    - [[Asymmetric encryption]]: Different keys are used for encryption (public key) and decryption (private key).
