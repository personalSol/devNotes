Moore's Law — the observation that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles approximately every two years, leading to an increase in computing power — is **no longer holding up in the traditional sense** as of the 2020s.

### What's changed?

- **Physical Limits**: Transistors are now approaching atomic scale (~3nm processes), making further miniaturization extremely difficult due to quantum effects, heat dissipation, and other challenges.
- **Cost**: Doubling transistor count has become exponentially more expensive, both in R&D and manufacturing.
- **Slower Pace**: The doubling rate has slowed down. Instead of every 18–24 months, it’s now closer to 2.5–3.5 years — and sometimes even longer, depending on the manufacturer.

### How the industry is adapting:

Moore's Law isn't "dead," but it's being **reinterpreted**. Instead of just packing more transistors:

- **Chiplets & 3D stacking**: Multiple smaller chips are combined to act as a single larger chip.
- **Specialized hardware**: GPUs, TPUs, NPUs, and ASICs (e.g. for AI) are taking over roles once handled by general CPUs.
- **Software optimizations**: Efficiency gains are coming more from software and better architectures (e.g., Apple Silicon, RISC-V) than raw transistor count.
