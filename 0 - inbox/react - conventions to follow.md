- if you are creating a component which return html tags then it's best to name that file with .jsx and name start with capital letter.  
- also the function to start with capital letter
	- this convention is important because it helps us differentiate components from actual html elements as html elements are written in small letter.
- vite without these conventions give error and CRA doesn't give error but doesn't work without capital name function
