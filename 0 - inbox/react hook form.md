react hook form is kinda simple.
- from it we use useForm
- useForm returns us register and handlesubmit
- register (is an event, idk how ) used to take the data from an element of component
	- register first takes unique name of that data and secondly and object in which we can give properties like
		- `required: true` 
		- validate: it takes a callback function which has value as parameter and validates the value using regex otherwise give a desired string
- handlesubmit is also an event in which we wrap our form submit action function. idk how it works
