JWT verification is fast and lightweight:
- Uses efficient HMAC-SHA256.
- No server memory is used to store session state.
- JWT is stateless and suitable for scalable systems.

Compared to traditional sessions:

| Feature        | JWT           | Session-based Auth |
|----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Memory Usage   | ✅ Low        | ❌ Higher           |
| Stateless      | ✅ Yes        | ❌ No               |
| Scalable       | ✅ Easily     | ❌ Needs storage    |
