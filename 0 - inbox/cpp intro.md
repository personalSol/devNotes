- we print using cout
- use endl ( akar end line for ending the line )
	- we can also use escape sequence "\n"
- use `;` as statement terminator
- to import we use `#include`
- boilerplate:
	- import `<iostream`
		- is a library
		- helps us in input and output
	- using namespace std;
		- here we can write it without this but then we will have to use `std::` in every function
		- to omit that we declare namespace at top and all the programs then by default use std
- to take input we use 'cin'
- now we will need to import every library we use everytime with `#include`
	- to save ourself from that, we use `<bits/stdc++.h>`
	- this includes all the library in c++
	- yes it does take some time to import all the libraries but it is negligible
