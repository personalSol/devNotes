- in js, we don't need to include `[]` or say that it's an array to declare it as an array
	- `const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- map: **Transforms** each element in the array and creates a **new array** with the transformed values.
- filter: filters according to function but only returns and doesn't transform
