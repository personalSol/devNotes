- in js, we don't need to include `[]` or say that it's an array to declare it as an array
	- `const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- map: **Transforms** each element in the array and creates a **new array** with the transformed values.
- filter: filters according to function but only returns and doesn't transform
- object doesn't have a .length property but we can use it by `Object.keys(obj).length`
- json is just a string so it does have length
