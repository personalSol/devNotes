> use to control one axis at a time

- is a flexible box
- use to target child tags of parent element 
- so we set on parents and it gets applied to child

flex and only flex box terminologies

justify-content - Main Axis ke upar khel sakta hu
align-items - Cross Axis ke upar khel sakta hu


when we do `flex-direction: column` then it tilts the thing. justify content still works on main axis but abb main axis ka direction hi change ho gaya hai.
- same goes for cross axis
