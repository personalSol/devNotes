Inside your CPU, there's a tiny fast storage called **registers**.  
These hold the address — just a number like `000101011010...`.

- A **32-bit CPU** uses 32-bit numbers for addresses (can count up to 4GB)
- A **64-bit CPU** uses 64-bit numbers (can count WAY higher)

So when your CPU wants to get data:

1. It puts the address in a register (like: “Go to box #000000010101...”)
2. RAM says “Here’s the data from that box!”
3. Done.
