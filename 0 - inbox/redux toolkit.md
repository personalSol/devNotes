#### how toolkit was different

redux toolkit was better than any other previous libraries as it had:
- a lot of abstraction which hide unnecesary things
- solved redux thunking problem ( whateever problem it was )

#### naming convention
- reducers are called slices here
- we add `Slice` at the end of name for any slice we create like `todoSlice.js`

#### syntax
- [[redux toolkit store]]
- [[redux toolkit reducer or slice]]
- [[react redux hook useSelector]]
- [[react redux hook useDispatch]]
-
