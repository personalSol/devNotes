- AI Automation: everything done by ai from collecting data to take decision to producing results
	- not possible right now ( still in theory )
- AI Augmentation: Work is done in collaboration of both human and AI
	- you have everything setup with all protocols and SOPs and systems
	- seniors are using agents and only analysing the final results and decisions before delivering
	- they are not checking it every hour if the system is working etc
- Autonomous stage: 
	- no senior position person is involved unless 
		- there is something that has no written steps
		- the steps are not working
