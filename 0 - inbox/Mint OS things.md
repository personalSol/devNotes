- applet is basically useful icons in panel which we can add or remove
- actions in linux allows you to do certain actions like two I have right now are:
	- open with vs code and another one is compress pdf
- to assign shortcuts for OS and other related stuff
	- go to keyboard from start and second menu in it
- to install we use debian package manager
	- `sudo dpkg -i <deb file>`
- all tabs view is called scale. It was by default set to Ctrl + Alt + down Arrow
	- there is also an applet for it
	- i set it to Super + Tab
