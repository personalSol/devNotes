### 🔹What is Mongoose?

- Mongoose is a **Node.js library** and **ODM (Object Data Modeling)** tool for MongoDB.
- Helps structure, validate, and manage MongoDB documents using schemas and models.

 🧩 **Mongoose Setup Flow**
```
/my-app
│
├── models/
│   └── user.model.js     ← Schema + model
│
├── config/
│   └── db.js             ← DB connection
│
├── index.js              ← App entry point
