#### ðŸŸ© File System vs DBMS

**Problems with File Systems:**

* [[data redundancy]] 
* [[data inconsistency]]
* Difficult data access
* Data isolation.
* [[data integrity]]
* [[atomicity]]
* Concurrent-access anomalies.
* Security limitations.

**Advantages of DBMS (i.e., solves all the above):**

* Eliminates redundancy and inconsistency.
* Easier data access and manipulation.
* Better integrity, security, and concurrency control.

### Types of databases

- [[sql databases]]: Use tables to store data and relationships between data (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- [[noSQL databases]]: Designed for more flexible data models and often used for big data or real-time web applications (e.g., MongoDB).
- **Graph Databases**: Store data in nodes and edges to represent relationships (e.g., Neo4j).
- **Vector Databases**: Used in ML to store data in the form of embeddings
