#### Constructor (Common Definition Across Languages)

A **constructor** is a **special function or method** that **automatically runs when an object is created**, and is used to **initialize the internal state (variables) of that object**, often using **values provided at the time of creation**.

##### Key Points

- It is **automatically invoked** during object creation.
- It **sets up initial values** of object attributes (also known as member variables or properties).
- It can have **different forms**:
  - **Default constructor** – takes no arguments.
  - **Parameterized constructor** – takes arguments to initialize variables.
  - **Copy constructor** – creates a new object as a copy of an existing one (common in C++).
  - **Move constructor** – optimizes object movement (C++11+).

##### Language Examples

- **Python**: Uses `__init__` as a constructor.
- **Java/C++**: Constructor has the same name as the class.
	- [[cpp constructor]]
	- [[java instance variable, this and constructor]]
- **JavaScript**: Uses a `constructor()` method inside the `class`.
	- [[js constrctor]]
