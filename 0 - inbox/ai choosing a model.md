for structured data: CatBoost, XG Boost or random forest models work better
for unstructued data: deep learning and transfer learning works better

- our goal is to minimize time between experiments and tuning the model as machine learning is an iterative process and if we are seeing a small increment in accuracy then it might not be worth it.
- machine learning models specially takes more time to train

Things to remember:
- don't be afraid to try new things as machine learning is a iterative thing and some things might not work
- start small and then add complexity as you go
- some models work better than others on different models
