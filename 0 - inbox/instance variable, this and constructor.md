instance variables:
- are the variables that are inside a class but not inside the class but not inside any method
- they are used to give properties/store value for properties for objects.


#### what I understood:

- there are mainly three things around classes to understand this:
	- instance variable
	- constructor
	- objects
- objects are real world entities which we create with the help of a class
	- an object contains all properties and methods of it's parent class
	- while creating a variable, we can pass values that are specific to that object
	- and we pass those values with the help of a constructor
	- now
