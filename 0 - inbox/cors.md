### 🔒 What is CORS?

- CORS stands for **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**.
- It's a **security feature implemented by browsers**.
- It allows a server to **say which other sites are allowed** to access its resources
- **Only browsers enforce CORS** (e.g., when a website uses fetch, axios, etc.)
- The **server always receives** the request.
- But the **browser blocks the response** from being accessible by JavaScript if CORS rules aren’t met.
- **Not enforced** in tools like:
	- Postman
	- curl
	- Node.js
	- Any backend code

🧪 Example (Node.js):
```js
const axios = require('axios');

axios.get('https://some-api.com/data')
  .then(res => console.log(res.data))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```
This works even if CORS isn’t enabled — because it’s **not in the browser**.

### 🚫 Without CORS

#### The Problem 

- By default, browsers follow a **same-origin policy**.
- This means: A website **can only request data** from its own domain.
- If `site-a.com` tries to get data from `api.site-b.com`, the browser blocks it.

#### ❗Why?

- To **protect users** from malicious sites trying to read sensitive data from other sites (like your bank).
- Without this rule, any site could try to steal private data from other domains.
- also any website can send thousands of request for your data and increase your server cost or entirely crash the server

---

### ✅ What CORS Solves

- CORS lets **servers give permission** to specific other domains.
- For example, an API server can say:
  > “I allow `abc.com` to access my data.”

- The server sends a **special header** like:
  ```
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://myfrontend.com
  ```
- Then the browser allows the request and gives access to the response.

---

## 🎯 Why Use CORS?
- To **securely share data** between domains.
- To **control which websites** can access your backend or API.
- To **prevent unauthorized websites** from using your server’s data in browsers.
