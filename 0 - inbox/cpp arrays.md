- stores similar type of data
- zero based indexing
- location of first ( zeroth index ) can be anywhere
	- but the second ( 1st index ) will be right after zeroth and so on
- in a array which is not initialized, c++ throws a random garbage value
![[cpp - call by reference and call by value#^fqmpwk]]



code
```cpp
int arr1[5] // 1d array of size 5 from 0 to 4
int arr2[2][10] // 2d array of 2 rows and 10 columns
```
