ðŸ‘¤ What about using a valid JWT and decoding it(which is very easy) to impersonate someone?

Yes â€” if the attacker somehow stole a valid token (e.g., via XSS, network sniffing, or poor storage), they can impersonate the user until:

- The token expires, or
- You implement a revoke/blacklist mechanism

This is not a flaw in JWT â€” itâ€™s a flaw in token theft protection.
