### ðŸ§  **Core**

- A **core** is a physical processing unit inside a CPU.
- Each core can handle **one task at a time**, independently.
- More cores = better ability to handle **multiple tasks simultaneously** (multitasking or parallel processing).

### ðŸ”„ **Thread**

- A **thread** is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions the CPU can manage.
- Modern CPUs use **Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT)**â€”Intel calls this **Hyper-Threading**â€”to let **one core handle two threads at once**.
- Threads are like **virtual cores**.


### ðŸ“Š Quick Example:

If a CPU has:

- **4 cores** and **8 threads**, that means:
    - Physically, there are 4 cores.
    - But each core can handle **2 threads** at the same time.
