Machine learning is a part of AI which has 3 types

- Machine learning have 3 different kind of techniques to perform a task:
    - Supervised Learning: every training sample from the dataset has a corresponding label or output value associated with it. As a result, the algorithm learns to predict labels or output values.
        - refer to data that already contains the solutions
    - Unsupervised leaning: there are no labels for the training data. A machine learning algorithm tries to learn the underlying patterns or distributions that govern the data.
        - Means the data which is being given to model doesn’t have a specific given answer attached to it to help the machine recognise that it is correct and it isn’t. Instead model have to use different type of data and use that to get one answer whereas in supervise Ig there is only one type of data
    - Reinforcement learning: the algorithm figures out which actions to take in a situation to maximize a reward (in the form of a number) on the way to reaching a specific goal.
