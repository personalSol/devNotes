#### **Analogy:** 
---
imagine, you have **a row of boxes**, and each box can store **1 book** (this is like **1 byte** in RAM).

Let’s say you have:
- 8 billion boxes = 8 GB RAM

Now to find a specific box (like box #56), you need to **label** each one with a number.  
That label is called an **address**.

The more boxes you have, the **more bits** you need to count that high.

- If you have 2 boxes → need 1 bit (0 or 1)
- If you have 4 boxes → need 2 bits (00, 01, 10, 11)
- If you have 8 boxes → need 3 bits (000 to 111)
- If you have 8 GB (8 × 2302^{30}230 boxes) → need 33 bits

#### **definition:** 
---
address is a unique value in bytes( 0's and 1's ) which is used to store the location of a byte in memory
- **Address length** (number of bits) is decided by **CPU architecture**, not RAM size
- A **32-bit CPU** uses **32-bit addresses**, can address up to **4GB RAM** (2 power 32 bytes).
- A **64-bit CPU** uses **64-bit addresses**, can address vastly more RAM (2 power 64 bytes).
- RAM is addressed **by bytes**, not by bits.
- **each byte in RAM has a unique address**.
- Each **address points to 1 byte** of data ⭐⭐ ( correct ) - 
- Addresses themselves are **binary numbers stored inside CPU registers**, not stored inside RAM.
- The **smallest addressable unit** by the OS and CPU is **1 byte**.
- Even if you want to store a single bit, the system allocates a full byte.
- 2322^{32}232 addresses in 4GB RAM are like labels for each byte and **do not consume storage space** inside RAM.
