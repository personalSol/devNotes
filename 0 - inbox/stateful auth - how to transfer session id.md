we can transfer it by:
- cookies
- headers
- response ( as a simple response )

### ✅ **1. Stateful Auth with EJS (Server-rendered frontend)**

- **Frontend type**: Server-side rendered (e.g., using EJS, Pug, etc.).
- **Authentication method**: Cookie-based.
- **Process**:
    1. User logs in via a form.
    2. Server authenticates the user and stores the session in memory or a session store (like Redis).
    3. Server sets a cookie (often a session ID) in the response.
    4. Browser automatically includes this cookie in future requests.
    5. Server uses the session ID to retrieve the user's session.
- ✅ No need to manually manage tokens or headers on the client.
- ✅ Built-in CSRF protection is often needed.

### ✅ **2. Stateful Auth with React (REST API frontend)**

- **Frontend type**: SPA (React, Vue, etc.).
- **Authentication method**: Can still use cookies, but often uses headers if it's token-based.
- **Options**:
    - **Cookies**:
        - You can still use cookies in React with `withCredentials: true` in Axios or fetch.
        - Requires server to set `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` and proper CORS setup.
        - Still stateful if session is stored on server.
    - **Headers (Token-based)**:
        - After login, server sends back a token (e.g., session token or even a short-lived JWT).
        - Client stores the token (usually in memory or localStorage — not recommended for sensitive tokens).
        - Client sends this token in the **Authorization header** for each API request.
        - Server uses the token to look up the session in its store.
- ✅ Gives frontend full control.
- ✅ Better separation of concerns.
- ⚠️ Requires careful handling of CORS, token storage, and CSRF/XSS security.
