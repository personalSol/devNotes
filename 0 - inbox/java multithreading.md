## THEORY
### ‚òï **Java Multithreading

- **Robust Support**
    - Java provides strong built-in support for **multithreading**, enabling applications to perform **multiple tasks simultaneously**.
    - Improves overall **performance** and **responsiveness**.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **How Multithreading Works in Java**

- **Definition**
    - Multithreading = concurrent execution of **two or more threads** to maximize **CPU utilization**.
    - Supported via the `java.lang` package ‚Äî easy to implement.

---

### üß† **Execution Environments**

- **Single-Core Systems**
    - Threads are managed by the **JVM** and **OS**.
    - Use **time-slicing** to switch between threads, creating the **illusion of parallelism**.
- **Multi-Core Systems**
    - JVM can assign threads to **different cores**, enabling **true parallel execution**.
    - Results in much better performance for CPU-bound tasks.

---

### üßµ **Thread Lifecycle in Java**

- When a Java program starts, the **main thread** begins execution and runs the `main()` method.
- You can create new threads in two main ways:
    - **Extending** the `Thread` class
    - **Implementing** the `Runnable` interface

## CODE Part

- to check the current thread: `System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName());`
