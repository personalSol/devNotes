### Summary in One Line:

- **Schema**: the instructions  
- **Model**: the factory that builds things using those instructions  
- **Document**: the actual thing you built  

Let's say you're building a LEGO world. Here's how **Model**, **Schema**, and **Document** work in **Mongoose**, like LEGO:

---

### 🧱 Schema = The Blueprint  
This is like the **instruction manual** for your LEGO figure.  
It tells you:  
- What pieces (fields) you need  
- What shape they should be (string, number, etc.)  
- Which ones are required

> For example:  
Your LEGO person must have a **head (name)**, **arms (age)**, and maybe **legs (email)**.

---

### 🤖 Model = The LEGO Factory  
This is like the **factory** that builds LEGO figures based on your blueprint.  
Once you have the schema, you give it to the model, and the model knows how to make those kinds of things.

> You might say: “Hey model, make me a new person!”  
And it uses the schema to build it right.

---

### 👦 Document = The Actual LEGO Person  
This is the **real, built figure** – a person made from your LEGO set.  
You can hold it, change its arms, or even send it to another city (save it to the database).

> It’s like:
```js
const newPerson = new PersonModel({ name: "Tom", age: 10 });
```
Here, `newPerson` is a **document**.
