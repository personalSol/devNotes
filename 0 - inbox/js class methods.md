In JavaScript classes, **methods are defined without the `function` keyword or arrow functions**. This is standard class method syntax.

```js
class Example {
    myMethod() {
        // This is correct
    }
}
```

- **No `function` keyword** is needed for class methods.
- **No arrow function** is needed for class methods.
