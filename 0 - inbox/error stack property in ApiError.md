## What is `stack`?
- The `stack` property in an error object contains detailed information about the sequence of function calls leading to the error.
- It is automatically generated by the server unless explicitly provided.

## Information Contained in `stack`
1. **Error Message**:
   - The descriptive message passed to the error object (e.g., `'something went wrong'`).

2. **Call Stack**:
   - A list of function calls active at the time of the error.
   - Includes:
     - File name.
     - Line number where the error occurred.
     - Column number (sometimes).
     - Function name (if available).

## Example of a Stack Trace

```js
Error: Resource not found at getUser (d:\Code\Project\others project\uber-clone\Backend\src\controllers\UserController.js:42:15) at processRequest (d:\Code\Project\others project\uber-clone\Backend\src\middleware\RequestHandler.js:18:10) at Server.handleRequest (d:\Code\Project\others project\uber-clone\Backend\src\server.js:105:5)
```


## Does It Contain Line Information?
- Yes, the stack trace includes:
  - **Line number** where the error occurred.
  - **Column number** (sometimes).

## How Is `stack` Generated?
- If not explicitly provided, `Error.captureStackTrace` generates the stack trace automatically.
- This method captures the current call stack and associates it with the error object.

## Practical Use
- Helps developers debug by pinpointing the exact location and sequence of code execution leading to the error.
