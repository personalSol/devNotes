# react-MOC

here will be all the notes around react-MOC

topic to learn:
- core of react ( state or UI manipulation, jsx)
- components reusability
- reusing of components ( props or properties )
- how to propogate change ( hooks )

Additional addon to react:
- router ( react doesn't have router and we have to install react-router-DOM package forr that)
	- basically changing url without loading page ( like in flipkart it changed url but the page didn't reload )
