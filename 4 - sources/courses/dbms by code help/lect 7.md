### ðŸŸ¦ Lecture 7: Relational Model

1. **Relational Model (RM)** organises the data in the form of relations (tables).  
2. A relational DB consists of a collection of tables, each of which is assigned a unique name.  
3. A row in a table represents a relationship among a set of values, and the table is a collection of such relationships.  
4. **Tuple**: A single row of the table representing a single data point / a unique record.  
5. **Columns**: represent the attributes of the relation. For each attribute, there is a permitted value, called **domain** of the attribute.  
6. **Relation Schema**: defines the design and structure of the relation, contains the name of the relation and all the columns/attributes.  
7. Common RM-based DBMS systems, aka RDBMS: Oracle, IBM, MySQL, MS Access.  
8. **Degree of table**: number of attributes/columns in a given table/relation.  
9. **Cardinality**: Total number of tuples in a given relation.  
10. **Relational Key**: Set of attributes which can uniquely identify each tuple.

### ðŸŸ© Important Properties of a Table in Relational Model

1. The name of relation is distinct among all other relations.  
2. The values have to be atomic. Canâ€™t be broken down further.  
3. The name of each attribute/column must be unique.  
4. Each tuple must be unique in a table.  
5. The sequence of row and column has no significance.  
6. Tables must follow **integrity constraints** â€” it helps to maintain data consistency across the tables.

### ðŸŸ© Relational Model Keys

#### 1. **Super Key (SK)**
- Any possible combination of attributes present in a table which can uniquely identify each tuple.

#### 2. **Candidate Key (CK)**
- Minimum subset of super keys, which can uniquely identify each tuple.  
- It contains no redundant attribute.  
- CK value **shouldnâ€™t be NULL**.

#### 3. **Primary Key (PK)**
- Selected out of CK set, has the least number of attributes.

#### 4. **Alternate Key (AK)**
- All CK except PK.

#### 5. **Foreign Key (FK)**
- It creates relation between two tables.  
- A relation, say `r1`, may include among its attributes the PK of another relation, say `r2`. This attribute is called FK from `r1` referencing `r2`.  
- The relation `r1` is known as the **Referencing (Child)** relation of the FK dependency.  
- The relation `r2` is known as the **Referenced (Parent)** relation of the FK.  
- FK helps to **cross-reference** between two different relations.

#### 6. **Composite Key**
- PK formed using at least 2 attributes.

#### 7. **Compound Key**
- PK which is formed using 2 FK.

#### 8. **Surrogate Key**
- Synthetic PK.  
- Generated automatically by DB, usually an integer value.  
- May be used as PK.

### ðŸŸ© Integrity Constraints

1. CRUD Operations must be done with some integrity policy so that DB is always consistent.  
2. Introduced so that we do not accidentally corrupt the DB.  

#### a. **Domain Constraints**
- Restricts the value in the attribute of relation, specifies the Domain.  
- Restrict the Data types of every attribute.  
- Example: We want to specify that the enrolment should happen for candidate birth year `< 2002`.

#### b. **Entity Constraints**
- Every relation should have PK.  
- `PK != NULL`.

#### c. **Referential Constraints**
- Specified between two relations & helps maintain consistency among tuples of two relations.  
- It requires that the value appearing in specified attributes of any tuple in referencing relation also appear in the specified attributes of at least one tuple in the referenced relation.  
- If FK in referencing table refers to PK of referenced table then every value of the FK in referencing table must be NULL or available in referenced table.  
- FK must have the matching PK for each value in the parent table or it must be NULL.

#### d. **Key Constraints**  
The six types of key constraints present in DBMS are:

1. **NOT NULL**: Restrict NULL values. Ensures every element has a value.  
2. **UNIQUE**: Ensures all values in a column are different.  
3. **DEFAULT**: Sets default value if no value is specified.  
4. **CHECK**: Maintains integrity of data before and after CRUD operations.  
5. **PRIMARY KEY**: Uniquely identifies each entity; must be unique and not null.  
6. **FOREIGN KEY**: Common attribute linking entities. Prevents actions breaking links between tables.
