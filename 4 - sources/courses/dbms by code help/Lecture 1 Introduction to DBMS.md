#### 游릴 What is Data?

* Collection of raw, unorganized facts.
* Has no meaning unless processed.
* Measured in bits and bytes.
* Can be recorded, but meaningless on its own.

#### 游릴 Types of Data

* **Quantitative**: Numerical (e.g., weight, cost).
* **Qualitative**: Descriptive (e.g., name, gender).

#### 游릴 What is Information?

* Processed and organized data.
* Provides context and supports decision-making.
* Extracted by analyzing data.
* Example:

  * Raw data: Local population details.
  * Info: 100 senior citizens, sex ratio = 1.1, 100 newborns.

#### 游릴 Data vs Information

* Data is raw; information is processed.
* Data lacks context; information has meaning.
* Information is derived from data.
* Decisions are made using information, not raw data.
* Data can exist without info, but not vice versa.

#### 游릴 What is a Database?

* Electronic system to store data.
* Allows easy access, management, and updates.
* Requires a DBMS to be useful.

#### 游릴 What is DBMS?

* Software + data = DBMS.
* A system to store and retrieve data efficiently.
* Supports operations: create, read, update, delete (CRUD).

#### 游릴 File System vs DBMS

**Problems with File Systems:**

* Data redundancy and inconsistency.
* Difficult data access.
* Data isolation.
* Integrity and atomicity issues.
* Concurrent-access anomalies.
* Security limitations.

**Advantages of DBMS (i.e., solves all the above):**

* Eliminates redundancy and inconsistency.
* Easier data access and manipulation.
* Better integrity, security, and concurrency control.
