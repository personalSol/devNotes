### üü¶ Lecture 3: Entity-Relationship Model

#### 1. Data Model
- Collection of conceptual tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics, and consistency constraints.

#### 2. ER Model
1. It is a high level data model based on a perception of a real world that consists of a collection of basic objects, called entities and of relationships among these objects.
2. Graphical representation of ER Model is ER diagram, which acts as a blueprint of DB.

#### 3. Entity
1. An Entity is a ‚Äúthing‚Äù or ‚Äúobject‚Äù in the real world that is distinguishable from all other objects.
2. It has physical existence.
3. Each student in a college is an entity.
4. Entity can be uniquely identified. (By a primary attribute, aka Primary Key)

**Types:**
- **Strong Entity:** Can be uniquely identified.
- **Weak Entity:** Can‚Äôt be uniquely identified., depends on some other strong entity.
  - It doesn‚Äôt have sufficient attributes, to select a uniquely identifiable attribute.
  - **Loan** ‚Üí Strong Entity, **Payment** ‚Üí Weak, as instalments are sequential number counter can be generated separate for each loan.
  - Weak entity depends on strong entity for existence.

#### 4. Entity Set
1. It is a set of entities of the same type that share the same properties, or attributes.
2. E.g., Student is an entity set.
3. E.g., Customer of a bank

#### 5. Attributes
1. An entity is represented by a set of attributes.
2. Each entity has a value for each of its attributes.
3. For each attribute, there is a set of permitted values, called the domain, or value set, of that attribute.
4. E.g., Student Entity has following attributes:
   - Student_ID
   - Name
   - Standard
   - Course
   - Batch
   - Contact number
   - Address

**Types of Attributes:**

- **Simple**
  - Attributes which can‚Äôt be divided further.
  - E.g., Customer‚Äôs account number in a bank, Student‚Äôs Roll number etc.

- **Composite**
  - Can be divided into subparts (that is, other attributes).
  - E.g., Name of a person, can be divided into first-name, middle-name, last-name.
  - If user wants to refer to an entire attribute or to only a component of the attribute.
  - Address can also be divided, street, city, state, PIN code.

- **Single-valued**
  - Only one value attribute.
  - e.g., Student ID, loan-number for a loan.

- **Multi-valued**
  - Attribute having more than one value.
  - e.g., phone-number, nominee-name on some insurance, dependent-name etc.
  - Limit constraint may be applied, upper or lower limits.

- **Derived**
  - Value of this type of attribute can be derived from the value of other related attributes.
  - e.g., Age, loan-age, membership-period etc.

- **NULL Value**
	- An attribute takes a null value when an entity does not have a value for it.
	- It may indicate ‚Äúnot applicable‚Äù, value doesn‚Äôt exist. e.g., person having no middle-name
	- It may indicate ‚Äúunknown‚Äù.
	  - Unknown can indicate missing entry, e.g., name value of a customer is NULL, means it is missing as name must have some value.
	  - Not known, salary attribute value of an employee is null, means it is not known yet.

#### 6. Relationships
1. Association among two or more entities.
2. e.g., Person has vehicle, Parent has Child, Customer borrow loan etc.
3. **Strong Relationship**, between two independent entities.
4. **Weak Relationship**, between weak entity and its owner/strong entity.
   - e.g., Loan `<instalment-payments>` Payment.

**Degree of Relationship:**
- **Unary**, Only one entity participates. e.g., Employee manages employee.
- **Binary**, two entities participates. e.g., Student takes Course.
- **Ternary** relationship, three entities participates. E.g , Employee works-on branch, employee works-on job.
- Binary are common.

#### 7. Relationships Constraints

**Mapping Cardinality / Cardinality Ratio**
1. Number of entities to which another entity can be associated via a relationship.
2. **One to one**, Entity in A associates with at most one entity in B, where A & B are entity sets. And an entity of B is associated with at most one entity of A.
   - E.g., Citizen has Aadhar Card.
3. **One to many**, Entity in A associated with N entity in B. While entity in B is associated with at most one entity in A.
   - e.g., Citizen has Vehicle.
4. **Many to one**, Entity in A associated with at most one entity in B. While entity in B can be associated with N entity in A.
   - e.g., Course taken by Professor.
5. **Many to many**, Entity in A associated with N entity in B. While entity in B also associated with N entity in A.
   - Customer buys product.
   - Student attend course.

**Participation Constraints**
- Aka, Minimum cardinality constraint.
- **Types:** Partial & Total Participation.
- **Partial Participation**, not all entities are involved in the relationship instance.
- **Total Participation**, each entity must be involved in at least one relationship instance.
  - e.g., Customer borrow loan, loan has total participation as it can‚Äôt exist without customer entity. And customer has partial participation.
  - Weak entity has total participation constraint, but strong may not have total.
