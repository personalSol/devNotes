### formula to make a better model?

![[Pasted image 20260111105623.png]]

- now we know in the field of tech whenever we need better or fast outputs we generally change the algorithm but that's not true for the field of ai
- in the field of ai when we need better models which is better at predicting next word then we dont necessarily need a new algorithm
- what we need is a more larger amount of data and give it a more fixed size of parameters
- next all we need is a bigger gpu cluster to train the model
- algorithmic progess is also something that these organizations do but this scaling process is the guaranteed path to get a better or more generalized model 

### capabilities of these models

- a llm is just a model with parameters which generate next word. It can only give answer related to the data is was trained on.
- Example shown in video by andrej is when we asks it to give scaler ai valuation with series of funding rounds then for this it uses browser to get the new information
- then we ask it to give an assumtion of their series A and B valuation for which it can use ratios and for this it uses calculator
- next we instruct it to give us a linear graph showing rise of valuation in relation to date for which it uses python interpreter with matplotlib library
- next we ask it to predict the valution of scaler ai by extrapolating the shown trend which it also does
- lastly we ask it to generate image of company for which it uses dalle model of open ai

### other capabilities

- a gpt model can also see images using computer vision and even generate websites based on that image
	- so we can give image with model to gpt and it can access information in the image along with the text to generate output
- shows the multi-modality of these modals
	- we can also now have gpt in speech to speech conversation
