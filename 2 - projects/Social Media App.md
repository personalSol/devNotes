# Social Media App
*Status: not_started/ planning /  on_hold / in_progress / complete*
### Short brief

this will be an app similar to bluelearn and discord and reddit. The difference is that this app will be secure and work fast. 

The mail mode of monitization I will have in start is showing google ads. I will get app google adsense thing. 

in start for home page we will just show the latest post and then we will show the most like in a week or month just like reddit


Features I have thought about:
- locally stored messages. but these locally stored will be encrypted
- 

Other things I am thinking it can have it:
- skool like paid community thing ( but I can already bet it will not work )
	- reason is indian aurdience will not pay just to join a community so making commissions out of it is difficult.
